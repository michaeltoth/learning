# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R script reads in 4 files from the UCI HAR Dataset, *X_test.txt*,
*X_train.txt*,*y_test.txt*, and *y_train.txt*. If the UCI HAR Dataset is 
downloaded as-is and placed within a subdirectory where the run_analysis.R 
script is located, you can simply run run_analysis.R to perform all necessary 
transformations and create the output file *tidy.txt*.  

Additional detail about the transformations that occur as a part of the script
can be found within the CodeBook.md file.
